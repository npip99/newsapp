                  During the Month of May, the Israel-Palestine conflict has had several major developments, almost all around the city of Rafah.<br/><br/>

                  In the first few days of May, ceasefire negotiations were attempted, but were failing.<br/><br/>

                  On May 6, Hamas accepted a ceasefire deal that would involve a limited hostage release, contingent on Israel pulling back their forces within Gaza. Israel's war cabinet unanimously voted against this deal. Around 1,000 protestors marched outside of Israel's Defense Headquarters, but it did not change the decision.<sup><a href="https://apnews.com/live/cease-fire-israel-hamas-updates">[1]</a></sup><br/><br/>

                  On May 6, after Israel decided to reject the ceasefire, Israel launched an offensive on Rafah. Over 50 air strikes occured on Rafah on May 6.<sup><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/hamas-says-accepts-proposal-for-cease-fire-with-israel">[2]</a></sup><br/><br/>

                  On May 8, Biden threatened to withhold arms if Israel launched a "full-scale invasion" of Rafah. Israel has made several hundred military strikes since, leaving 80 dead. Biden has said that this is not considered a "full-scale invasion", and Biden has continued military aid to Israel.<sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-bombs-us-has-paused-sending-israel-have-killed-civilians-2024-05-08/">[3]</a></sup><br/><br/>

                  Throughout May, numerous European leaders have stated extreme concern over the humanitarian situation in Rafah<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_offensive#Europe">[4]</a></sup>, the most often cited reason being that Rafah has previously been the designated safe haven for displaced Palestinians to go to. The EU's official statement is that Israel should end the Rafah Offensive, and failure to do so would undermine relations between the EU and Israel.<sup><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-urge-israel-end-offensive-rafah-palestine-immediately/">[5]</a></sup><br/><br/>

                  On May 12, Egypt has joined South Africa's genocide case against Israel as a result of the Rafah Offensive. Israel's former foreign minister describes this as a "diplomatic blow", as Israel has looked to hold better relations with Egypt than other neighboring nations.<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/5/12/egypt-deals-diplomatic-blow-to-israel-by-joining-icj-genocide-case">[6]</a></sup> For context, Turkey/Syria/Jordan/Iraq/Iran had already joined South Africa's genocide case prior to the Rafah Offensive.<br/><br/>

                  Overall, the UN has estimated 600,000 Palestinians displaced from Rafah since May 6.<sup><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/5/15/israels-war-on-gaza-live-new-nakba-as-hundreds-of-thousands-flee-attacks">[7]</a></sup>

                      <ul>
                        <li>The release of hostages was contingent on Israel's withdrawal. Israel's stance is that they will not withdraw without assurance that Hamas will never attack again. Israel's position is that they will not be safe from Hamas unless Hamas is destroyed.</li>

                        <li>If Israel chooses not to invade Rafah, it is not clear how to proceed with destroying Hamas. Israel has already cleared most of Gaza outside of Rafah, and is now contending with Hamas members that are within Rafah.</li>

                        <li>If Israel chooses to delay, this will extend the humanitarian crisis. Israel should act sooner. Delaying the invasion would make the war last longer than if Israel moves quickly by invading now.</li>

                      Opinion: Anti-Invasion of Rafah
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Palestinian civilians have had nowhere to go since the Israeli invasion of Gaza has occured. Over 2.3 million Palestinians, 80% of the Gazan population, have been forced to leave their homes. Most, to Rafah. It is unclear, with an invasion of Rafah, where these civilians can go.
                        </li>

                        <div class="dislike-button" onclick="dislike('anti-1')">👍</div>
                        <li>A ceasefire was offered, but Israel chose not to accept. This makes Israel at fault. Hamas did not say that Israel must withdraw from Gaza, but simply pullback slightly and still remain within Gaza. Considering the release of hostages, Israel should have accepted these ceasefire terms rather than continuing the war with an invasion of Rafah.</li>
                        <li>Gaza is nearly entirely destroyed. Hamas is not a significant threat. Israel could ceasefire now, and be safe. The invasion of Rafah is not justified.</li>
                        <div class="like-button" onclick="like('anti-2')">👍</div>
                        <div class="dislike-button" onclick="dislike('anti-2')">👍</div>
                        <li>There have been more than 35,000 fatalities in Gaza. The war has violated any argument of proportionality. Hamas's actions on Oct 7 do not justify the extent of Israel's campaign in Gaza. Israel should accept Hamas's demand to withdraw and free the hostages.</li>
                        <div class="like-button" onclick="like('anti-3')">👍</div>
                        <div class="dislike-button" onclick="dislike('anti-3')">👍</div>
                        <li>Rafah receives significant aid through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. The Rafah Offensive has already disrupted this. The humanitarian crisis that will result is not acceptable. The EU agrees with this assement.</li>
                        <div class="like-button" onclick="like('anti-4')">👍</div>
                        <div class="dislike-button" onclick="dislike('anti-4')">👍</div>

                    </div>
                  </div>

                  Your opinion on whether you are Pro- or Anti- the invasion of Rafah is likely dependent on your belief of whether or not the scale of the war is justified in the first place.
