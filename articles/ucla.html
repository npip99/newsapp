        <h3>Opinion: Pro-Palestine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A core Pro-Palestine belief is that the protests must not stop until the war ends. This is rooted in a belief that Israel's response to Oct 7 is not proportional and is not last resort.</li>

            <li>The core belief of protest organizers is to be peaceful. Violent protesters have been condemned. Often, most violent protesters are not UCLA students but rather outside agitators.</li>

            <li>Pro-Palestine protesters discuss police brutality and unjust violence on protesters. Medics have treated broken bones caused by police weapons. For peaceful protesters, this treatment is seen as a violation of the right to assembly.<sup><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/15/medics-ucla-protest-say-police-weapons-caused-serious-injuries/73704114007/">[1]</a></sup></li>

        <h3>Opinion: Pro-Israel</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pro-Israel students on campus have expressed feeling unsafe and marginalized due to the protests, often consider the protests to be anti-semitic.</li>

            <li>The violence inflicted by counterprotesters is often blamed on pro-israeli students and faculty. Many Jewish students condemned the violence and emphasized that it was not representative of the broader Jewish community at UCLA. Additionally, they pointed out that many of the violent protesters were not affiliated with the university, complicating the situation further.</li>

            <li>While most pro-palestine protesters simply demand an end to the war, there is significant rhetoric implying that Jews should completely evacuate the Middle East. Pro-Israel opinions point to phrases and slogans such as "from the river to the sea", and "anti-Zionist", where Zionism is the political belief that Jews should be allowed in Israel.</li>
