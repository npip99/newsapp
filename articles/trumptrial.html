<p>The latest updates from the Trump trial reveal significant developments:</p>
<p> Former President Donald Trump has been held in contempt of court for the tenth time by Judge Juan Merchan for violating the gag order. The judge warned that further violations could result in jail time, emphasizing the seriousness of adhering to court rules despite Trump's status and the potential impact on his presidential campaign​ </p>
<p>Jeffrey McConney, a former Trump Organization controller, testified about the reimbursement process for the $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. He detailed how the reimbursement was managed, involving hand-written notes and approval from Trump Organization executives, including Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Additionally, it was revealed that the payments shifted from a trust account to Trump's personal bank account in March 2017​ <sup><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-trial-full-coverage-defense-lawyer-accuses-stormy-daniels-of-lying-about-sexual-encounter-with-trump-124601399.html">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p> Stormy Daniels has returned to the witness stand, where she faced rigorous cross-examination by Trump's defense team. They questioned her motives and financial benefits from going public with her story. Daniels firmly responded that her primary intent was to reveal the truth, not to gain financially​. </p>
<p> The defense has played audio recordings and questioned Daniels to portray her as seeking monetary gain and leveraging the situation before the 2016 election. They aim to undermine her credibility and suggest that her actions were financially motivated rather than based on truth​.</p>
<p> Trump announced that he is appealing the gag order, which restricts him from commenting on the case. He criticized the order as unconstitutional and claimed it hinders his ability to speak freely about the trial proceedings​ </p>
